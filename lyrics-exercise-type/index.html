		<h1>Soul Meets Body</h1>
		<h2> By Death Cab for Cutie</h2>
		<br>

		<p class= "verse">I want to live where <em>soul meets body</em>
		<br>And let the sun wrap its arms around me
		<br>And bathe my skin in water, cool and cleansing
		<br>And feel
		<br><em>Feel what it's like to be new</em></p>


		<p class= "verse">'Cause in my head there is a <em>Greyhound station</em>
		<br>Where I send my thoughts to far off destinations
		<br>So they may have a chance of finding a place
		<br>Where they're far more suited than here</p>

	
		<p class= "verse">I cannot guess what we'll discover
		<br>When we turn the dirt with our palms cupped like shovels
		<br>But I know our filthy hands can wash one another's
		<br><em>And not one speck will remain</em></p>


		<p class="chorus">I do believe it's true
		<br>That there are roads left in both of our shoes
		<br><em>But if the silence takes you
		<br>Then I hope it takes me too</em>

		<br>So, brown eyes, I'll hold you near
		<br>'Cause you're the only song I want to hear
		<br>A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere</p>


		<p class= "outro">Where soul meets body
		<br>Where soul meets body
		<br>Where soul meets body</p>

		<p class= "chorus">And I do believe it's true
		<br>That there are roads left in both of our shoes
		<br><em>But if the silence takes you
		<br>Then I hope it takes me too</em></p>

		<p class= "chorus">So, brown eyes, I'll hold you near
		<br>'Cause you're the only song I want to hear
		<br>A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere</p>

		<p class="outro">A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
		<br>A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
		<br>A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere</p>
	</body>
