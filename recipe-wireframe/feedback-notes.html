		<h1>Wireframe Notes:</h1>
		<h2> James says: </h2>
			<p>-focus this week on clear communication</p>
			<p>-flow and scale of information</p>

		<h2>Megan Stansbury says:</h2>

			<p>-None of my sketches are for a phone, and having legibility on the phone is what I need to work on</p>
			<p>-It makes the most sense to have a one column layout</p>

			<p>-The first sketch on the page seems the best to put on a phone screen</p>
			<p>-title of recipe on the top, on the side will be hard to read and fit other info, possibly put the title on a photo</p>
			<p>-draw marshmellows with faces, smores, fire, drawing your images
			heirarchy on headers, and body copy</p>
